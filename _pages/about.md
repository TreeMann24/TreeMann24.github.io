My name is Aidan and I am a aspiring photographer and game designer. I love doing sports photography and landscape photography and hopefully end up shotting photos for a NHL or MLB team. I also love playing video games and hopefully I can make one. Some of my favorite games are Rainbow Six Siege and Minecraft. I am good with Java and C# and am also good at learning languages.
